# Automated-attendance-sytem-using-face-recognition-with-OPENCV
This is an automated attendance system built with opencv using python.

Hi guys,this is Dhamodaran,I request everyone to read this readme file fully to know how to run these codes should be executed.

Please make sure you have installed these packages in your laptop/computer before running these codes
  1.opencv_contrib_python-4.1.2.30 (make sure you install the right version of opencv..search how to install the specificied versin of opencv_contrib to know about the commannds which will install the package for you)
  2.pandas
  3.Numpy
  4.PIL
  5.pickle
If you don't have the above mentioned codes please do install them in your sytems before executing the code while others are basic
packages that most of the pycoders use.

Download the all the files that I have included in my repository.

***dhamodaran_face_classifier.xml is the trained model file which can be used to detect only my friend's faces.
So ,i want all you to read the following instructions more clearly.
  1.Download all the files that i have included in my repository in the same directory(student detsils.csv and Mar2020.csv are optional)
  2.create a sub-directory called 'images'
  3.create sub-directories in the name of your friends and relatives and include their images in the respective sub-directories
  4.Now run the trainer.py file(THIS WILL TAKE SEVERAL MINUTES BASED ON THE PERFORMANCE OF YOUR PC)
  5.After the successful execution of the training,its time to recognise people on real time
  6.Now run the live_face_recogniser.py file and mark your attendances
  7.The students details.csv and Mar2020.csv are examples to show you demo of the system.There is no need to download these two CSV files.
  
 ***Hope You Are Getting Caught..
